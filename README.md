MVVM Architecture to organize code in a clean and efficient way, with building user interface. Seperate structural code for viewing logic and data. Quick to access and test.
    - **Model**: Represents the data and business logic. (Property.swift,Category.swift)
    - **View**: The user interface (UI) that the user interacts with. In Swift, this is often your SwiftUI views or UIKit components.
